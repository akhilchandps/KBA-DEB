He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, particularly his famous equation 
            𝐸
            =
            𝑚
            𝑐
            2
            E=mc 
            2
             , which describes the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) with 
            𝑐
            c being the speed of light. This equation revolutionized the understanding of energy, matter, and the universe.
            
            Einstein's work laid the foundation for modern physics and had profound implications for quantum mechanics and cosmology. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing quantum theory</p>
